Problem 12. Development Environments

    Perform a research (e.g. in Google or Wikipedia) and provide a short list with popular development environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio.
    Write in a text file called “list-of-IDEs.txt” at least five IDEs along with 2-3 sentences about each of them. Use English

Solution 12.
-----------------


1. CodeLite:
An Open-Source, cross-platform IDfor C+ and C++ coding languages, CodeLite works on all major platforms. CodeLite offers a variety of features, including two built-in completion engines, compilers, refactoring, code navigation and more.
